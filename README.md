# Intro

**REST** = REpresentational State Transfer  
**GraphQL** = Graph Query Language  

Both REST and GraphQL are use to build **APIs** = Application Programming Interfaces.  
Those allow different applications to communicate with each other over the Internet.  

An API takes requests from a **client**, which can be a web application or a mobile app.  
Then it retrieves the requested data from a **server**.  
And finally, it sends the data back to the client.  

GraphQL and REST are 2 different approaches to building APIs.
- GraphQL prioritizes, giving clients exactly the data they request, and no more
- REST is more "talkative", often providing more information than needed

# REST

REST is an architectural style that relies on HTTP requests to interact with resources.  

# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to retrieve data from multiple data sources in a single API call.
